# Product Cipher (version 1.0)

This Command line application can basically encrypt a text file.

The user Should provide a single encryption key for the encryption and decryption, Encryption key should be at least 8 characters long. 

Simply copy the application to the place where your Text file exists and rename the plain text file to "text.txt" and run the application.

Once encryption is done "encrypted.txt" file will be generated.
If you select decryption, "decrypted.txt" file will be generated.

The application uses Permutation and Random substitution methods recursively 5 times to Encrypt/Decrypt files. The single Encryption key which is entered by the user is used by the both algorithms to determine their relevant encryption keys.
